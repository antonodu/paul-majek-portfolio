The show is divided into two parts, and each work on display belongs to one or the other part. Appendix leans into its ‘other’ meaning: the anatomical appendage. Instead of revealing knowledges which are latent within the body, Appendix imagines what kinds of knowledge could ever be possible inside those parts which are ‘extra’, ‘unnecessary’. The artists approach the appendix to varying degrees of literalism: overflowing bodies, found objects, a proliferation of office stationery, an excess of discarded materials, and so on.",

The exhibiting artists express what ‘haven’ means to them and how it resonates through their art practice.

In 1898, Swiss artist Félix Vallotton exposed the private lives of the aristocracy in a series of ten woodcuttings: Intimités. Now, artist/writer duo Paul Majek and Sam Spencer present Intimacies, After Vallotton. Hazy blue portraits are brought to life with accompanying dialogues, each piece offers a glimpse into the subject’s lives and grapples with what it means to be close to another person. Reimagining the erotic, often melancholic relationships depicted across Vallotton’s ten woodcuts, Paul Majek’s paintings - drawing upon photographs from his own family archive - encourage us to expand our definition of intimacy, exploring parental and familial connections as well as romantic ones. Moving beyond the heteronormative love portrayed in Vallotton’s series, Sam Spencer’s duologues offer examples of queer and platonic intimacy.",

The exhibition centers on their exploration of the color blue as a conduit of love and memory. In their work, as in Nigerian tradition, blue affirms its power to summon emotion and evoke intimacy. Majek’s paintings ebb dreamily between dimensions, while Olulode’s indigos stir a sense of familiarity, lingering in tender, romantic moments. Both UK-based artists draw on their ancestry, and in returning “home” to Nigeria, they reconnect knowledge frayed by time and migration. Paul Majek takes blue-hued lucid dreaming as a point of departure to probe the materiality of liminal spaces. His oil, acrylic, and charcoal works on wood or canvas recreate the terrain of the subliminal, transforming woodgrain into liquid form and imprinting Nigerian symbols that render his figures transparent and ethereal. Referencing archival family photographs of people and spaces only partly known, Majek approaches the archive as its own autonomous language, linking memory, love, generational dialogue, and spirituality.",
