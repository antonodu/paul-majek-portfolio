    " Paul Majek (b. 2000) is based in London and received his BFA in Fine Art from the University of Oxford’s Ruskin School of Art in 2023 and completed his postgraduate studies at the Royal Drawing School in 2024. His work explores the fluidity of figures, engaging with themes of memory, generational dialogue, and spirituality. Working primarily with oil, acrylic, and charcoal on wood, canvas, and paper, he employs layering techniques to experiment with opacity and transparency. Drawing from family archives and personal narratives, he integrates painting with video, sculpture, and found objects, creating altar-like installations that evoke intimacy and a sense of home.",
   
    "In 2024, Majek participated in a residency at Borgo Pignano in Italy, an experience that provided a unique and inspiring environment for his practice. That same year, he was honored with the Next Gen Masters award, part of the Bicester Village x LUX Magazine Celebration of Emerging Artists. His work was also showcased at The Scalpel with The Maffioli Art Group, where his painting Don’t Let The Sundown Catch You (2023) was acquired, leading to him receiving the 2024 Morrison Foerster Art Prize. His work was featured in Stretching the Light, the inaugural edition of Rele’s London Summer Series (2024), an exhibition highlighting emerging artists who push the boundaries of experimentation. He also exhibited in Within Our Midst at O’DA Art Gallery in Lagos, Nigeria, a duo show alongside visual artist Michael Igwe..",

    "Majek was shortlisted for the Ingram Prize in 2024, with his selected work, The Pattern (oil, acrylic, and charcoal on wood, 2023), exhibited at Unit 1 Gallery Workshop in London. His drawings were also included in Best of the Drawing Year 2024 at Christie’s, a group exhibition showcasing works on paper from graduates of the Royal Drawing School’s postgraduate program. In 2025, he will be exhibiting in a group show with KATES-FERRI PROJECTS and O’DA Art in New York City."
